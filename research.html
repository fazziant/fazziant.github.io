        		<h1>Hi there!</h1>
				<p>
	        I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB).
		  My main scientific interests lie in numerical linear algebra and scientific computing with applications in system and control theory. 
					<br>
					<hr>
		In the last years my research focused on a novel double iteration algorithm for solving some matrix nearness problems. 
		This was applied to the problem of computing approximate common factors of scalar polynomials and matrix polynomials. 
		The numerical solution of these problems was motivated by some applications in system and control theory, 
		e.g. the computation of distance to uncontrollability for Linear Time Invariant systems.
